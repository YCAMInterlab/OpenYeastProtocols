## Plate Growth Medium to Liquid Culture

*Do this if you see both yeast colonies and what might be mold. Or if the colonies have grown and spread too much.

### Items Required
- Plate growth medium with colonies
- 15mL conical tube containing liquid culture
- Pipette (P1000), tip (P1000)
- Sterilized toothpick
- Tweezers
- Rubbing alcohol
- Rubber gloves
- Permanent marker
- Garbage bag

### Sample Procedure

1. Wear rubber gloves and disinfect your hands with alcohol. Disinfect the clean bench with alcohol. Use alcohol to disinfect the items to be put in the clean bench.
2. Place 15mL conical tubes on the tube stand, pour 2 mL of the growth medium into each tube, and leave the cap loosened.
3. Decide which colonies are to be extracted from the plate growth medium. *Choose standalone colonies that are not fused to another colony. Choose colonies that are well away from mold, etc. The colony should not be too small nor too large.
4. With tweezers whose tips have been well wiped with rubbing alcohol, grab a sterilized toothpick and scoop up the colony on the plate growth medium. Drop the toothpick into the conical tube and put on the cap. During this time, do not put the plate growth medium's petri dish cover upside down.
5. On the conical tube, use a permanent marker to write information such as the number.
6. Set the incubator to 30Â°C and put in the conical tube to incubate. Keep checking the condition of the culture. If carbon dioxide is produced under static conditions or if it is turbid compared to the start of the culture, transfer it to a plate growth medium.
