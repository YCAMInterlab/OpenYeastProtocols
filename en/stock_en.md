## How to Preserve Yeast

### Items Required
- 1.5mL microtube or PCR tube
- Tough-Spot sheet (tube labels)
- Permanent marker or laser printer
- Glycerol
- Sterilized toothpick
- Vortex mixer

### Sample Procedure
1. Put sterilized 15% glycerol solution into a microtube.
2. Use a toothpick to extract samples from the plate growth medium.
3. Use the vortex mixer to make a suspension liquid.
4. Write the serial number on the label and affix it to the tube's cap.
5. Store at -80°C.

*Liquid growth media can be stored for several weeks at 4°C. Plate growth media can be stored for a few months at 4°C with the petri dish covered with plastic tape or Parafilm. Permanent storage of the above is possible at -80°C. (At -30°C, ice will form, so it cannot be stored longer than six months.)

#### Sample recording method:
- On a spreadsheet, enter the specimen's serial number (corresponding to the tube label), remarks (search tags), researcher's name, and date.
- For each specimen, take notes on A4 paper. For each specimen, write notes on a different sheet of paper. Explain the origin of the specimen, the procedures, etc., and file it.

*When discarding the specimen, autoclave it first, then dispose of it properly.
