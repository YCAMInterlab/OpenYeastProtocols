## How to Culture on Plate Growth Media

### Items Required
- Sample (collected)
- Sterilized container containing sterilized water
- Sterilized disposable petri dish (9cm diameter)
- Pipette and tip
- Sterilized conical tube
- Rubber gloves
- Disinfectant alcohol spray
- Spreader
- Clean bench
- Incubator
- Garbage bag

### Sample Procedure
1. Wear rubber gloves and disinfect your hands with alcohol. Disinfect the clean bench with alcohol.
2. Use alcohol spray to disinfect the bags containing sterile, disposable petri dishes, containers containing samples, containers containing sterilized water, the spreader (while packaged), pipette, and pipette tips. Then put them in the clean bench.
3. Drop the sample into the container containing sterile water to make a concentration of 10% (10 g in 90 mL or 10-part diluted solution) for good suspension. Use a pipette to take a sample and dilute with 9 parts of sterilized water for the suspension. This will make a 100-part diluted solution. This can be further diluted by repeating this step.
4. Use a pipette to take 1 mL of the solution, and sprinkle it on YPD plate growth medium. Use a spreader and rotate the plate to spread the solution over the entire medium. Then put on the cover.
5. Set the incubator to 30°C, place the plate growth medium upside down, then incubate.
6. When the colonies appear, put it in the refrigerator set to 4°C to slow down the growth.
