## Diluting the Liquid Culture and Inoculating on Plate Growth Medium

*Dilute the liquid growth medium by 100 parts to 1 (990 μL of unused liquid growth medium + 10 μL of liquid growth medium (liquid culture) and again inoculate 10 μL at a time.

### Items Required
- Plate growth medium
- Conical tube containing liquid culture already cultured
- Liquid growth medium
- 15mL conical tube
- Pipette (P20, P1000) and tip (P20, P1000)
- Spreader
- Tube stand
- Rubbing alcohol
- Rubber gloves
- Permanent marker
- Garbage bag

### Sample Procedure
1. Wear rubber gloves and disinfect your hands with alcohol. Disinfect the clean bench with alcohol. Use alcohol to disinfect the items to be put in the clean bench.
2. Place 15mL conical tubes on the tube stand and loosen the caps.
3. Attach the tip (P1000) to the pipette (P1000) and put 990 μL of liquid growth medium into an empty conical tube.
4. Attach the tip (P20) to the pipette (P20) and put 10 μL of the liquid culture into the conical tube in step 3. This makes a solution diluted 100 parts to 1.
5. Attach the tip (P20) to the pipette (P20) and inoculate 10 μL of the diluted solution made in step 4 onto the plate growth medium.
6. Put the cap on the conical tube and discard the tip.
7. Put down the pipette and conical tube and take out the spreader from the packaging. *Carefully take out the spreader from the bag so it does not touch the bag's opening. If it touches the bag's opening, discard it.
8. Hold the spreader with your right hand (or left hand) and set it on the plate growth medium. Then use your left hand (or right hand) to rotate the plate growth medium so that the culture is spread evenly over the entire plate. Then move the spreader three or four times vertically to imprint the culture onto the medium.
9. Put on the cover, turn it over, and write the date, conical tube number, etc., on the edge.
10. Set the incubator to 30°C and incubate.

#### Disposal methods  
- The waste materials from the procedure above are to be separated from ordinary garbage.
- Wrap petri dishes in Saran wrap or aluminum foil and throw it away.
- Dispose of the conical tube as is, even if contains liquid.
