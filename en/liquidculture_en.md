### How to Culture on Liquid Growth Media

#### Items Requiredl
- Sample (collected)
- Conical tube containing liquid medium
- Tube stand
- Tweezers
- Rubbing alcohol spray
- Rubber gloves
- Clean bench
- Incubator
- Garbage bag

#### Sample Procedure
1. Wear rubber gloves and disinfect your hands with alcohol. Disinfect the clean bench with alcohol.
2. Use alcohol spray to disinfect the conical tube containing the liquid medium (put it on a tube stand), the container containing the sample, and the tweezers. Then place them on the clean bench.
3. Using tweezers with disinfected tips, take out the sample from the container and put it into the conical tube containing the liquid medium. Cap the tube. Allow the sample to immerse in the liquid medium.
4. Set the incubator to 30Â°C and put in the conical tube to incubate the liquid medium.

*If you have a homeothermic shaking incubator, it is better to use it instead.  
*After this procedure, dilute the liquid culture and inoculate it on plate growth medium to grow the colony. This is called the "enrichment culture" method. Since a natural sample is transferred to an artificial growth medium, the bacterial count ratio will be reversed if it is advantageous for the minority species in the original sample.
