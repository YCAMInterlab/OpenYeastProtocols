## How to Collect Yeast

### Items Required
- Conical tube
- Tube stand
- Tweezers
- Lighter
- 80% ethanol
- Rubber gloves
- Permanent marker
- Camera
- Shopping basket (to carry the above tools)

### Sample Procedure 
1. Look for flowers, etc., where yeast may be growing. *Take photos of it.
2. Wear rubber gloves and disinfect them with 80% ethanol.
3. Put 80% ethanol in a conical tube or other container, immerse the tips of the tweezers into the ethanol and take them out, then heat the tips with a lighter. Using a tube stand will make it easier.
4. Use the tweezers to pick up a yeast sample, and put it in a container that has a cover (sterilized disposable conical tube, Ziploc container, etc.).
5. Use a permanent marker to write the collection date and time, location, serial number, etc.

*Since insects often carry yeast, it is highly possible to find it on flowers.

>"Many flowering plants have nectaries at the base of flower petals. Since the nectaries have nutrients for yeast, we can naturally expect yeast growing on the flowers. The yeast is brought to the flowers by pollinating honey bees, carpenter bees and butterflies that suck the nectar, and other insects. The yeast also goes from flower to flower.” (from "_Kobokin no Seikatsu_", p. 140)

>"In the natural world, yeast is commonly found on plants and in their immediate environment such as fruits, leaves, flowers, and sap. The amount varies greatly depending on the season. It is most abundant in summer." (from "_Hakko no Giho_", p. 72)

>"Collecting method: In a new, unused nylon bag, collect flower petals from all over Japan. Remove the flower stems, peduncles, receptacles, and sepals. The yeast separator need not be limited to flowers. It can be anything, but a separator with a high concentration of sugar is highly likely to have yeast." (from "_Seishu Seizō-yō Kōbo no Bunri oyobi Jitsuyō-ka_", p. 299)
